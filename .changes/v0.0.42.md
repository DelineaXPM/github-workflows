## v0.0.42 - 2023-03-03

### ðŸŽ‰ Feature

- Add new template for caching trunk to improve the results of linting checks performance.
- Add new template for annotations based on trunk result.
  This will eventually run seperately from trunk to allow forks to securely be annotated as well.
  At this time it's just a unused template.
