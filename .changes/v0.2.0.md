## v0.2.0 - 2024-10-07

- _new-product-feature_: Improve linting with additional job that validates changie entry exists when it should be included. Certain exclusions are added such as labels for `dependencies` by Renovate, and `no-changie-required` label for exceptions. This will use PR comment type so automatic changes required will show up.
- _new-product-feature_: Template `changie-trigger-release` can be passed additional file paths that `git add {}` would take allowing repos like dsv-k8s to include chart and other files that get modified during changie update to be included.
- _bug-fix_: Use the calculated label instead of hard coded value for the dependencies add.
