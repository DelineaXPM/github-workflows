## v0.1.0 - 2024-01-23

### 🎉 Feature

- New template to simplify maintenance by workflow dispatch adding required changelog entries to create a pull request that bumps the version and runs changie commands to generate a new release.

This is done to help the development effort to bump a release based on dependency updates without having to clone and run cli tools locally.

- New template to trigger a changie based release from just CI. Will create PR for release to be reviewed and approved.

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- Maintenance release due to updated dependencies.
