## v0.0.46 - 2024-01-18

### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- Adjust linting permissions back down to avoid issues with downstream calls requiring too many permissions.

## v0.0.45 - 2023-04-11

### ðŸ¤– CI & Build

- Add aqua policy env variable to allow installation of policies in current project. This further improves supply chain security for ci tooling and dev tools.

## v0.0.44 - 2023-04-11

### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- Change lint, test, and scan to not cancel on concurrency match. This is causing downstream problems with composite based using pipelines.

## v0.0.43 - 2023-03-03

### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- Lint workflow now runs aqual install with the args: `--tags lint` to allow setting up tooling via Aqua. This can help eliminate the need to resetup sealed versions of tools like Golangci-lint which are already configured in aqua.yaml and resetup via trunk can be slow or cause mismatch in versioning.

## v0.0.42 - 2023-03-03

### ðŸŽ‰ Feature

- Add new template for caching trunk to improve the results of linting checks performance.
- Add new template for annotations based on trunk result.
  This will eventually run seperately from trunk to allow forks to securely be annotated as well.
  At this time it's just a unused template.
