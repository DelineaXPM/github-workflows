## v0.0.43 - 2023-03-03

### ðŸ”¨ Refactor

- Lint workflow now runs aqual install with the args: `--tags lint` to allow setting up tooling via Aqua. This can help eliminate the need to resetup sealed versions of tools like Golangci-lint which are already configured in aqua.yaml and resetup via trunk can be slow or cause mismatch in versioning.

## v0.0.42 - 2023-03-03

### ðŸŽ‰ Feature

- Add new template for caching trunk to improve the results of linting checks performance.
- Add new template for annotations based on trunk result.
  This will eventually run seperately from trunk to allow forks to securely be annotated as well.
  At this time it's just a unused template.
